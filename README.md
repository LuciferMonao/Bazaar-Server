# INFORMATIONS FOR github.com/LuciferMonao/Bazaar-Server

To use the programm, there has to be a python script named get_api_token in the directory.
The file has to have to following content:

def get(arg1):
    if arg1 == 0:
        return("TOKEN THAT WONT BE PUBLISHED, not used")
    if arg1 == 1:
        return("HERE YOUR HYPIXEL API TOKEN")

This is in order of security.
